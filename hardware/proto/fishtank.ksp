# Placeholder for fishtank.ksp (Keyshot scene file, binary format)
# Scene Description:
# - Geometry: iPhone-shaped fish tank, 0.7mm convex glass front/back, seamless sapphire shell.
# - Materials: Gorilla Glass (front/back), water volume (60ml), micro-bubble system via piezo nozzle (Lightning port).
# - Etching: Tetra hash (Sapienski triangles, 15-micron depth at crown, 5-micron at edge).
# - Lighting: Micro-LED strip along seam, color-shifts (2700K-6500K) based on gaze detection.
# - Sensors: OLED pixel array with embedded photo-diodes for gaze tracking (2.7M points).
# - Animation: Bubbles track viewer gaze, fish (neon tetras) follow light vector.
# - Output: Live render at 1080x1920, 20 FPS, with dynamic bump map updates.

# Note: Actual .ksp file is binary and generated in Keyshot. This text serves as metadata.
# Load in Keyshot via arch_id.py, which applies tetra hash and live etching.
