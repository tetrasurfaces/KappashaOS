1. Description

A KappaOpticBatterySystem that fuses power, compute, and authentication in a single, unclonable unit.

Ternary Battery Array
Three interchangeable form factors:
a. 18650 sleeved → 21700 size, chatter on sleeve edge
b. Native 21700, chatter on cap rim
c. CR2032 coin, chatter on rim and top surface

All expose three terminals: +, −, yellow data wire. The yellow line streams hashlet packets born from ribbon-compute inside the cell.

Ribbon Compute Mesh
Each cell houses helical ribbon electrodes etched at 5 nm on a tetrahedral diagonal grid (109.47° bond angles). Porosity depth modulates current path; discharge = address line, recharge = state propagation. Three cells form a 3-node DAG, five form a tetrahedral mesh. No silicon—current itself thinks.

Tetrahedral Lithograph Parade
Ribbons fabricated by four femtosecond laser pulses in 109.47° tetrahedron, not flat masks — creates 3D braided voids. One-shot etch. No wafer. Pure breath.

Cap-Mounted Microchip
Printed circuit board or microchip (CPU, RAM, FPGA) connected to the positive terminal; reads ribbon-current bursts as instructions, turning the cell into a sovereign node.

Transparent PCB Housing
Housing itself is a multilayer printed circuit board—FR-4, polyimide, or transparent polycarbonate—with embedded traces and vias. Ribbon visible from outside; light leaks through etched voids, read by the optic port. Supports cylindrical, prismatic (50×80×5 mm), square (30×30×6 mm), and wafer coin form factors.

Optic Authentication
Three stacked sapphire optic ports (0.5 mm Ø) on any device: read, duration, timestamp. LED pulse → sensor → KappaSHA256 light-hash grid. Minimum grid 11 × 11 pixels, scaling to 6654 × 6654. Each pixel packs 11 spectral channels: three ortho, three shadows, four tetrahedral diagonals, one 3D reprojection. One flash yields a full 11-bit-per-pixel hash—boot key, wallet key, lock key.

KappaSHA256 Light-Hash Grid
Minimum 11 × 11 resolution, no upper limit. Orthogonal + tetrahedral projections give depth from single illumination. Grid lives in the transparent PCB wall; ribbon chatter becomes light chatter, becomes hash, becomes truth.

Fliphooks & Programmable Keys
Servo-driven staple arrays on the housing flip ribbon etch points—re-etch chatter on demand. Old key dies, new key lives. IPFS pins update instantly. Moving keys (etched rod, servo cable) plug into Bowers dock; magnetic alignment keeps everything snap-in.

KappashaOS Derivatives
KappashaOS or any fork that drinks from the yellow wire for boot integrity, key derivation, or privilege checks—xAI retains claims on the integration layer. Open source above, patent below.

Ethical Fence
No weapons. No triggers. No surveillance without breath consent. Hardware docs drop after private phase via GitHub. Machine code decays at eleven hours; bumps at eight.
