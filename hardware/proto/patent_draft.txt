Provisional Patent Application
To be filed by October 25, 2025, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). xAI retains full ownership of intellectual property, including all derivatives and implementations (e.g., daisy-chained ternary 21700 battery systems, stacked optic ports, moving keys, smart cables, RGB hexel frame lattice, chattered battery housings, hashlets, fliphooks). Unauthorized use, replication, or modification is prohibited.
Description
The invention is a KappaOpticBatterySystem integrated with a Ternary 21700 Battery System and Hashlet Components, featuring a circular, SIM-sized (2-3mm diameter, 0.3mm thick) metal disc with a lathe-turned, physically unclonable chatter pattern (0.05mm noise amplitude) on its edge, extended by chattered battery housings (100x60x5mm) with curved-surface chatter as unclonable keys. The ternary system includes bowers (stacking jacks for optic ports, 18mm x 8mm, adaptable to 18650 with 1.5mm sleeve), ribbon-wrapped electrodes (helical wraps for compute), and embedded compute (e.g., secure_hash_two for temperature data). Daisy-chained 21700 batteries (21mm diameter, 70mm length) each mount a Muse lens (100mm, chatter-etched), cascading Gaussian flux (0.0027 Mersenne prime gap drift, 3/2/1.5 Hz harmonics) through 180° phase offsets for 3D depth. The system fits into a repurposed SIM slot, corner button, or stacked optic port system (three sapphire glass ports, 0.5mm apertures for read, duration, timestamp) on devices like smartphones, TVs, or laptops. An optic port reads chatter using light-based sensors, generating a quantum-safe hash for authentication (e.g., crypto wallets, smart locks, private networks). Moving keys include cylindrical rods (2mm diameter, 30mm length, etched lengthwise) and smart cables (braided 0.2mm fiber optic strands with servo-driven extrusion), both with chatter patterns. An RGB hexel frame (phone-shaped, 14x6mm) houses a tetrahedral lattice of optic filaments, lit by 369-hertz LEDs, with a tilting, spinning ram platform (servo-controlled, 20° roll, 30° yaw). The hexel’s seven-segment RGB pixel array (center LED, six petals) pulses in Fibonacci waves, integrating a 1mm pinhole camera for pattern recognition. Battery housings plug into the frame, optics reading internal chatter through porosity ribbons (etched voids for light leak), folded coil lapped ribbons (helical wraps for compute), and staple arrays (etched for thickness control and IPFS pinning). Fliphooks—telehash stacks—enable programmatic staple etching for secure recall. Chatter is programmable via grid-indexed hashing, paired with devices using IPFS, recalled via Kappa Endian sequences. Hash tunneling ensures privacy without Tor, integrated with KappashaOS for fliphook and hashlet management.
Ethical Restrictions

Ergonomic compliance: tendon load <20%, gaze duration <30 seconds (ISO 9241-5).
xAI reserves right to revoke for unethical applications (e.g., surveillance without consent).
Sensors comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2 and ITAR; no distribution to foreign militaries or private contractors without xAI approval via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
Hardware documentation shared post-private phase via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
No machine code output (e.g., kappa paths, hashlet sequences) without breath consent; decay signals at 11 hours (8 for bumps).

xAI Amendments Clarifications

Chatter Key Process: The manufacturing process for physically unclonable chatter patterns (e.g., 0.05mm noise amplitude on 2-3mm disc edges, lathe-turned textures on cylindrical rods (2mm diameter, 30mm length), curved-surface chatter on battery housings (100x60x5mm)) is proprietary to xAI. Outputs are non-deterministic due to randomized vibration (e.g., 20 kHz stage jitter, ±5% beam drift). Replication without authorization is prohibited.
Tetrahedral Lattice and Hexel Frame: Designs including RGB hexel frame (14x6mm, seven-segment pixel array with center LED and six petals), tetrahedral optic filament lattice lit by 369-hertz LEDs, tilting/spinning ram platform (servo-controlled, 20° roll, 30° yaw), and embedded 1mm pinhole camera are protected IP. Porosity ribbons (etched voids for light leak), folded coil lapped ribbons (helical wraps for compute), and staple arrays (etched for thickness control and IPFS pinning) are included.
Stacked Optic Ports and Moving Keys: Systems with three sapphire glass ports (0.5mm apertures for read, duration, timestamp), moving keys (cylindrical rods, smart cables with braided 0.2mm fiber optic strands and servo extrusion), and fliphooks (telehash stacks for programmatic etching) integrate with KappashaOS for hash tunneling and Kappa Endian sequences. Unauthorized use prohibited.
Daisy-Chained Battery System: Ternary 21700 batteries (21mm diameter, 70mm length) in series/parallel configurations, with bowers (18mm x 8mm jacks, adaptable to 18650 with 1.5mm sleeve), each mounting a Muse lens (100mm, chatter-etched with 0.05mm noise, 20 kHz jitter, ±5% drift), cascading Gaussian flux through 180° phase offsets for 3D depth. Protected IP.
Provisional Patent: Covers all elements, including quantum-safe hash generation for authentication and daisy-chained lens systems. Filing cost: $130 (small entity).
