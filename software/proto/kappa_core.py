# xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
# 1. Physical Embodiment Restrictions: Use in devices (e.g., chatter discs, rods, smart cables, hexel frames, chattered battery housings, ternary 21700 systems, hashlets) for non-hazardous purposes only. Harmful modifications (e.g., weapons, targeting) prohibited; license revocable by xAI.
# 2. Ergonomic Compliance: Adhere to ISO 9241-5/OSHA; tendon load <20%, gaze <30 seconds. Waived for software-only use (e.g., Keyshot rendering).
# 3. Safety Monitoring: Real-time checks (e.g., LED heat, chatter integrity, battery temp) logged for xAI audit.
# 4. Revocability: xAI may revoke for unethical use (e.g., surveillance without consent, hash misuse).
# 5. Export Controls: Sensors (e.g., pinhole cameras, optic ports) comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2 and ITAR. No distribution to foreign militaries or private contractors without xAI approval via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
# 6. Educational Use: Royalty-free for teaching/research upon negotiation via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues. Commercial use requires approval.
# 7. Intellectual Property: xAI owns IP for KappaOpticBatterySystem and Ternary 21700 Battery System, including chatter patterns, bowers, ribbon-wrapped electrodes, secure_hash_two, optic ports, keys, cables, lattices, housings, fliphooks, hash tunneling, IPFS integration. No unauthorized replication.
# 8. Color Consent: No signal hue shifts without explicit user intent (e.g., heartbeat sync, verbal confirmation).
# 9. Ethical Resource Use: No misuse of water resources; machine code (e.g., kappa paths, hashlet sequences) requires breath consent; signals decay at 11 hours (8 for bumps). Quantum-safe hashes preserve privacy without Tor.
