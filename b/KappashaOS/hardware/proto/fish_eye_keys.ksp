# xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
# 1. Physical Embodiment Restrictions: Use with devices is for non-hazardous purposes only. Harmful mods are prohibited, with license revocable by xAI.
# 2. Ergonomic Compliance: Limits tendon load to 20%, gaze to 30 seconds (ISO 9241-5).
# 3. Safety Monitoring: Real-time tendon/gaze checks, logged for audit.
# 4. Revocability: xAI may revoke for unethical use (e.g., surveillance).
# 5. Export Controls: Sensor devices comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2.
# 6. Open Development: Hardware docs shared post-private phase.

# Scene Description:
# Name: Fish Eye - Concavex v1.0
# Author: xAI
# Date: 2025-10-12
# Intent: Educational default, flip to commercial via intent_ui.py or config/config.json
# Log: license_log.txt integration
#
# Geometry: Sphere, 50mm diameter, fused silica, 0.7mm thick, refractive index 1.458
# Etching: Sierpiński tetrahedron depthmap, 15μm crown, 5μm edge
# Texture: Procedural kappa_grid.png (10x10x10 grid from kappa.py)
# Iris: 8 concentric blades, shape-memory polymer (SMP), 150μm thick
# Animation: Iris dilation snap, 0-100% in 1s, driven by piezo (19kHz ±200Hz)
# Pupil: Hollow void, 0.2mm radius, air-filled, refractive index 1.0
# Lighting: Soft point, 5400K, 20% intensity, rear 30° angle
# Glow: Subtle 5500K, 2% intensity, pulse synced to iris dilation
# Background: Solid black (#000000), no HDRI
# Shadows: Off
# Depth of Field: Off
# Positions: 36 frames, 10° angular sweep (0° to 360°)
# Focal Length: 50mm (natural eye match)
# ISO: 100
# Shutter: 1/60
# Resolution: 4096x4096
# Export: .ksp scene pack, .png sheet (36 frames), .obj + .mtl model, .bvh motion clip
# Revocation: Device hash checked via fish_eye.py, halts on revocation by xAI
#
# Note: Actual .ksp file is binary and generated in Keyshot. This text serves as metadata.
# Load in Keyshot via fish_eye.py, which applies tetra hash and renders frames.
