gpiozero # for modern Pi GPIO handling (e.g., sensors, LEDs, servos) with Pi 5+ support
# Note: whisper.cpp installed via brew/clone, not pip
# Note: On Debian and Ubuntu:
# sudo apt update
# sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
# Then retry:
# pip install pyaudio
# Additional Notes (Oct 2025): gpiozero added for enhanced hardware integrations in new PUF/kappa modules; it's backward-compatible with RPi.GPIO but simpler for mocks and multi-pin ops. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your env. If conflicts arise (e.g., with ray/scipy), pin versions like numpy==2.1.1.
