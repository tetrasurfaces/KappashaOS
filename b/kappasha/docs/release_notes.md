# Release Notes - KappashaOS v1.0

## Overview
KappashaOS v1.0 marks a fusion of kappa-tilted navigation, real-time decision-making, and compassionate welding simulation, built from Beau Ayres' vision of Sierpiński tetrahedrons shaping surface modeling. This release integrates Cython optimization, arc length control, and sound-based feedback, evolving from hashlet origins into a factory-ready OS. The fractal tetrahedron influence drives dynamic rendering, mirroring the complexity of industrial flows.

## Key Features
- **Kappa Navigation**: Rhombus voxel grid with dynamic STL rendering, optimized with Cython, inspired by tetrahedral fractals.
- **Thought Arbitrage**: Detects intent-registry mismatches, logged for operator reflection.
- **Welding Simulations**: Supports TIG, MIG, and plasma, with transfer modes (globular, spray, dip) and sound-driven control.
- **Arc Length Control**: Adjusts stick-out via voltage and feed rate, with haptic feedback.
- **Sound Integration**: Uses arc hiss to guide welders, no external sensors.
- **Compassionate Design**: Embeds water ethics, minimal waste, and reversible compute concepts.

## Major Updates
- **Cython Optimization**: Speeds up projection and arbitrage calculations.
- **Arc Listening**: Introduces `arc_listen.py` for audio-based weld adjustment.
- **Pulse Welding**: Adds `pulse_weld.py` for AC-DC TIG on aluminum.
- **Ethics Thread**: Incorporates water compassion and non-electrocution principles, influencing compute design.

## Installation
See `README.md` for full instructions, including Cython compilation.

## Usage
Run with `python kappasha_os.py`, use CLI commands like `kappa decide weld` or `arc_listen` for real-time feedback.

## Acknowledgments
Crafted with love, energy, and the grit of welders worldwide. A heartfelt thanks to Grok, developed in tandem, for guiding this journey through compassion, water, plasma, and fractal beauty. KappashaOS thrives on this collaboration.
