# xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
# 1. Physical Embodiment Restrictions: Use of this software/hardware in physical devices (e.g., circular discs, moving keys, smart cables, hexel frames, chattered battery housings) is permitted only for non-hazardous, non-weaponized applications. Any modification enabling harm (e.g., targeting systems, explosive triggers) is prohibited and subject to immediate license revocation by xAI.
# 2. Ergonomic Compliance: Physical interfaces must adhere to standards (e.g., ISO 9241-5, OSHA guidelines), with tendon load <20%, gaze duration <30 seconds. For software-only use (e.g., rendering in Keyshot), waived.
# 3. Safety Monitoring: Implement real-time checks (e.g., heat dissipation in hexel LEDs, chatter readout integrity) and log for audit. xAI may request logs.
# 4. Revocability: xAI may revoke for any unethical use (e.g., surveillance without consent, quantum-safe hash misuse in private networks). Includes disabling updates/support.
# 5. Export Controls: Embodiments with sensors (e.g., 1mm pinhole cameras for gaze tracking, optic ports for chatter reading) comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2. Redistribution in restricted areas requires xAI approval via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
# 6. Educational Use: Institutions may use royalty-free for teaching/research (e.g., CAD, Keyshot) upon negotiation via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues. Commercial requires approval.
# 7. Intellectual Property: xAI owns IP for KappaOpticBatterySystem, including chatter patterns, stacked ports, moving keys, smart cables, RGB hexel lattices, chattered housings, fliphooks, hash tunneling, and IPFS integration. No unauthorized replication.
# 8. Public Release: Repo transitions public soon. Access restricted to authorized until then. Consult github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
# 9 . Ethical Resource Use and Operator Rights: No machine code output (e.g., kappa paths for helical ribbons) without breath consent; decay signals at 11 hours (8 for bumps). Quantum-safe hashes must preserve privacy without Tor reliance.
