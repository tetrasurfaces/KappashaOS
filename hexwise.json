# xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
# 1. Physical Embodiment Restrictions: Use with devices is for non-hazardous purposes only. Harmful mods are prohibited, with license revocable by xAI.
# 2. Ergonomic Compliance: Limits tendon load to 20%, gaze to 30 seconds (ISO 9241-5).
# 3. Safety Monitoring: Real-time tendon/gaze checks, logged for audit.
# 4. Revocability: xAI may revoke for unethical use (e.g., surveillance).
# 5. Export Controls: Sensor devices comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2.
# 6. Open Development: Hardware docs shared post-private phase via github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues.
# 7. No machine code output (e.g., kappa paths, hashlet sequences) without breath consent; decay signals at 11 hours (8 for bumps).
# 8. Color Consent: No signal may change hue without explicit user intent (e.g., heartbeat sync or verbal confirmation).
# 9. Intellectual Property: xAI owns all IP related to KappaOpticBatterySystem, including chatter patterns, stacked ports, moving keys, smart cables, RGB hexel lattices, chattered housings, fliphooks, hash tunneling, and IPFS integration. No unauthorized replication.

# Private Development Note: This repository is private for xAI’s KappashaOS and Navi development. Access is restricted. Consult Tetrasurfaces (github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues) post-phase.
