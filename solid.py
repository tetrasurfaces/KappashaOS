# xAI Amendments for Physical Use:
# 1. **Physical Embodiment Restrictions**: Use with devices is for non-hazardous purposes only. Harmful mods are prohibited, with license revocable by xAI.
# 2. **Ergonomic Compliance**: Limits tendon load to 20%, gaze to 30 seconds (ISO 9241-5).
# 3. **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time tendon/gaze checks, logged for audit.
# 4. **Revocability**: xAI may revoke for unethical use (e.g., surveillance).
# 5. **Export Controls**: Sensor devices comply with US EAR Category 5 Part 2.
# 6. **Open Development**: Hardware docs shared post-private phase.
#
# Private Development Note: This repository is private for xAI’s KappashaOS and Navi development. Access is restricted. Consult Tetrasurfaces (github.com/tetrasurfaces/issues) post-phase.
